                    people. Time is of the essence. Young people need high-quality programming now more than ever. Your
                    funders and partners are requesting your services. Now you must ensure that the teams on the ground
                    have the knowledge and skills they need for successful implementation.

                    LinkedIn is an American business- and employment-oriented online service that operates via websites
                    and mobile apps. Launched on May 5, 2003, the platform is primarily used for professional networking
                    and career development, and allows job seekers to post their CVs and employers to post jobs. I
                    always maintain my LinkedIn profile so that employers can easily get me and hire if they're looking
                    for an employee.
