                    LinkedIn is an American business- and employment-oriented online service that operates via websites and mobile apps. Launched on May 5, 2003, the platform is primarily used for professional networking and career development, and allows job seekers to post their CVs and employers to post jobs. I always maintain my LinkedIn profile so that employers can easily get me and hire if they're looking for an employee.
